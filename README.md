This is a Streamlit application that I will be posting on the Streamlit cloud.
To make this work, you need the following envirnomental variables
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = 
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT = https://api.langchain.plus
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 = false
OPENAI_API_KEY = 
MOSS_MASHER = Use this variable to set a token to whatever you want if you have the OPENAI_API_KEY already in your system
